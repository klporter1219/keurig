I created this Keurig site for my Advanced Multi-Device Web Development course, as a fully functioning MVC application. You are able to login and logout of an account that you create through the website. You can add coffee maker's to your cart by clicking the "buy now" button. Once you click "buy now", it will show you how many coffee makers are in your cart. Once you click your cart, you can see the coffee makers that you have added. You can also clear your cart to start over if you do not want the selected coffee makers.

I made this to showcase my ability to recreate a design and to create a fully functioning MVC application.
